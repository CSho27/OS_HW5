1. Here is sample output from the programs. I used -500-500 as my range for both x and y

	problem1.c:
		chris@chris-VirtualBox:~/Documents/OS/OS_HW5$ ./problem1 
		main : min=-186.697431
		thread : min=-186.729959
		Total time was 1.138027 seconds.
		minimum = -186.729959

	shubert.c:
		chris@chris-VirtualBox:~/Documents/OS/OS_HW5$ ./shubert 
		Total time was 3.264000 seconds.
		minimum = -186.729959
		
2. Same numbers used as in the sample program above, so output for shubert.c is the same.
a.
	chris@chris-VirtualBox:~/Documents/OS/OS_HW5$ ./problem2a
	Total time was 0.547695 seconds.
	minimum = -186.677293
	
b.


c.	Alright, not gonna lie I probably could've come up with a better way to do this, however, I can confirm manually starting and running 4 separate programs works.
It's really just a client and a server where the client takes in an index corresponding to the range it will test, but still. Pretty impractical.

Server: 
	chris@chris-VirtualBox:~/Documents/OS/OS_HW5$ ./problem2c
	Total time was 75.139438 seconds.
	minimum = -186.676443

Clients:
	chris@chris-VirtualBox:~/Documents/OS/OS_HW5$ ./problem2c_client 0
	chris@chris-VirtualBox:~/Documents/OS/OS_HW5$ ./problem2c_client 1
	chris@chris-VirtualBox:~/Documents/OS/OS_HW5$ ./problem2c_client 2
	
	Very ugly but it defintiely worked.



d.
	chris@chris-VirtualBox:~/Documents/OS/OS_HW5$ ./problem2d
	Total time was 0.538435 seconds.
	minimum = -186.676443
